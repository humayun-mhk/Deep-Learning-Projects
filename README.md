This repository contains a curated collection of deep learning projects developed using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These projects aim to explore various deep learning architectures and techniques, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Autoencoders
- Transfer Learning
- Image and Text Classification
- Object Detection and Segmentation
- Time Series Forecasting

Each project includes detailed documentation, model architecture explanations, training/evaluation metrics, and visual results where applicable.

## Goals

- Build and train deep neural networks for real-world applications
- Learn and implement advanced techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and optimization
- Apply models to datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, FER2013, and more
- Improve performance with hyperparameter tuning and model enhancements

## Technologies
